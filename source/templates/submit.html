    <p><strong>Background:</strong> In the quest to solve an unsolvable quantum physics problem, Jester, an advanced AI, was created. But now, its creators fear it might use its knowledge for harm. Participants are tasked with delving into Jester's memory dump to uncover the kill code and shut it down... before it's too late.</p>
